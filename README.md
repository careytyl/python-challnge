# Python

This Python repository featuers two .py files -- PyBank and PyPoll. They each use their associated data file to analyze information: PyBank examines an 86-month period of financial data for sum, average, maximum, and minimum values, then exports the results to a .txt file. PyPoll analyzes polling data to determine the total number of voters and the total number per candidate, then declares the winner. It is also exported to a .txt file.
